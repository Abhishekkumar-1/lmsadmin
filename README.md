## Getting Started

Steps:

Download the file Code.

Run the command 
    -npm install ,if this doesn't work
    -npm install --force
    
Create an .env file and create the following variables in it:
MONGODB_URI
GITHUB_ID,
GITHUB_SECRET,
GOOGLE_ID,
GOOGLE_SECRET,

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
